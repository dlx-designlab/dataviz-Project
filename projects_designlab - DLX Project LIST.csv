Understanding the electrical activity between these neurons might allow researchers to develop bio-intelligent machines. Therefore, a synthetic neuron bundle might be the first building block to creating bio-intelligence. When bio-synthetic neurons replace silicon-based computing, they will bring huge advantages. They consume far less energy; they can process more complex data; they are biocompatible and biodegradable. Aura is a health monitoring device that reads your biochemical signals and is the first deployment of a bio-intelligent machine. Modified bio-synthetic neurons which are sensitive to volatile organic compounds sweep the surrounding air to identify the user and to read their bio-chemical signature. A microchannel structure made from bio-synthetic neurons gives Aura its intelligence. It analyses the bio-electrical signals from the olfactory antennae to assess the health of the individual based on pre-learnt patterns. In our concept, the bio-intelligent machine is made from neuron bundles as seen in Ikeuchi Lab (top + lower right) which are connected to create a 3D network of neurons in order to mimic the structure and functionality of a brain.

,Thinking Wave,NICT,Alisa Koegel,Nakano Lab,,Future Mobility,User test,Complete,7/2020,5/2021,10,,"As we progress towards a world of fully autonomous vehicles, designing semi-autonomous solutions will be essential in addressing road and behavioural safety. In particular, designing and calibrating trust will be a key part of delivering a safe experience for all stakeholders. The Thinking Wave is an ongoing exploration on visualising the capabilities of vehicle system so that drivers can understand when and how they should take over the wheel. Over-trusting a vehicle system’s capacity to drive and handle situations can lead to hazardous accidents but the same result could occur by under-trusting. Under-trusting AVs in simple scenarios and forcefully taking the wheel could increase risk of accidents. Human error may become a factor in when otherwise mitigated. In conjunction with mobility research teams at the University of Tokyo, we are building the Thinking Wave as a testable prototype. At present, DLX is exploring two visualisation designs. Concept one, called “tidal” is a wave which indicates the level of difficulty the vehicle is encountering, suggesting the driver to adjust control or takeover. It fluctuates in intensity (amplitude, frequency and speed) to reflect the effort of the vehicle system. We took inspiration from existing and familiar visualisations of human ECGs as such biometric data is intuitive. In the same way humans under stressful conditions such as heart-rate, the vehicle would reflect intensity with multiple waves close to one another of high amplitude when going through a difficult handle-situation. For example, in the instance of driving through heavy rain, visibility is lowered and the vehicle’s sensors may be compromised in detecting its surroundings. As the system would struggle to adequately handle the situation, the wave would appear high, frequent and fast. Concept two, called “tandem” is a multi-information layer visualisation. It focuses on showing the collaboration dynamic between vehicle and driver on top of also showing the vehicle’s effort throughout various scenarios. A circle, symbolising the driver and a square symbolising the vehicle system changes in size, position and rotation speed to reflect this. The leading controller within a scenario would be on the top (front) of the visual. The larger/smaller each shape shows which of the two is putting more/less effort into handling the scenario respectively. As for the vehicle system’s thinking effort, the more complex the situation (regardless of which was primary or dominant), the faster it spins. The Thinking Wave designs show potential in helping drivers not only calibrate their expectations but also establish trust in AVs. We also believe that it can be an effective tool which evolves both with the technology and driver to establish a safer and more effective AV future. If the Thinking Wave can learn driver’s handling tendencies, it could help the vehicle system adapt and control in a more preferable manner to the driver. Furthermore, with software updates and enhancements in autonomous systems, the wave’s confidence visualisation can be altered to help drivers recalibrate their trust. This concept demonstrates potential in educating drivers while giving way for innovation to still be enabled and adequate to the designs. It could even be said that because of this, it is a suitable and promising concept that continues to evolve beyond near-future autonomous innovations."

Quality of life will be improved by having public transport that can identify you and your pick-up location seamlessly, thereby reducing any friction in commuting. We believe that 6G can decrease reliance on private vehicles in sparsely populated rural areas. A key element of this system is the 6G enabled travel card that will allow you to summon a bus when you need it. We believe that the rural ageing communities will be mobilized by the help of cheap public transport where people can meet fellow villagers and travel together.  This service encompasses a new model for public transport: one that has no predefined routes, is available anywhere on demand, and whose fleet size is dynamically adjusted to balance demand. 6G ability to act like a distributed sensor and precise positioning capabilities are used to run a fleet of inexpensive, driverless shuttles in the rural areas.​ Shuttles connect to a digital twin* of the territory that is aware of every connected device and takes environmental real time information from the network.

Here, we show the adaptations to increasing extreme weather conditions and how connected mobility elements (traffic lights, billboards, navigation systems, etc) could use 6G’s capabilities and drive people/traffic away from areas that are unsafe in real-time. Technology is going to help reduce vital decision-making time and optimise the way emergency situations are handled. The system is constantly measuring personal risks, such as social risk, geographical risk, disaster risk, traffic congestion, etc. With this data, the system can clearly provide every citizen with a unique plan of action. 6G antennas could sense the environment similarly to how radars detect objects' presence and determine type, shape, relative location and velocity; coupling this data with imagery from cameras and other sensors could enable a large-scale, real-time digital instance of the territory. 6G-connected public infrastructures, personal devices, and granular public data sources will be able to measure parameters such as social vulnerability, disaster probability, temperature, traffic levels, and live images and therefore respond to traffic congestion, damaged roads, fires, or accidents.

In this future of super precise navigation, you will no longer ask ""Where is the supermarket?"" but ""Where can I find salad?"" instead. This could drastically decrease screen reliance to get around places and provide a better experience in complex situations ( eg. in stations, hospitals, or shopping malls).  Compared to 5G, 6G will rely on many smaller antennas to operate, thus offering a higher resolution in retrieving the position of connected devices."

Unlike industrial composting operations, our system is sized for on-site integration into restaurants, cafés, and canteens, as these businesses produce a steady amount of organic waste but lack practical composting options.Tabemaru enables them to process food waste into frass using BSF larvae, while minimizing odor, contact with insects, and maintenance requirements. The system is designed for integration into existing operations, making BSF composting possible at a local scale. Our design applies entomology research to create optimal conditions for BSF larvae within a automated system that fits seamlessly into existing operations. Beyond the physical composter, we are developing a reverse logistics model that completes the nutrient cycle. The frass produced by the units would be collected and redirected to local farms, ideally through the same supply chains delivering ingredients to participating businesses. This approach creates measurable circularity by linking waste management with regenerative agriculture. If the approach is proven effective through our staged validation process,, Tabemaru could play a crucial role in the transformation of the food system into a more circular model that can be deployed across different urban and peri-urban contexts."

These autonomous buses need to switch from automatic to manual driving when encountering obstacles like park on the side of the road Additionally, it is necessary to make citizens aware of these buses and encourage their cooperation. We designed icons for road markings to let the citizens know about the bus, and floating optical illusion road markings to deter unnecessary parking on the roads used in the tests."

It connects and visualizes the voices of the visitors and the sounds of nature and its wildlife. Blue skies and forest trees are projected onto the ceiling of the tunnel, and the chirping sounds generate vibrant images of the birds as they fly across the ceiling. The voices of the visitors are also visualized as virtual sound particles that emerge and diffuse, creating an immersive experience."
,Attune,,Yuri Klebanov,Sato Lab,,Health & Wellbeing,User test,Complete,2/2019,12/2020,22,,"Studies recently conducted in Matsunaga Lab shows that the shapes of human capillaries in the figure tips indicate our health condition and transformed depending on our life habits such as sleep, exercise, diet and drinking. The collaboration between DLX Platform of UTokyo and Bezalel Design Academy of Israel developed a novel system, Attune, which creates musical tunes from the image of capillaries in the fingertips. It allows people to easily and intuitively monitor their health conditions just by putting the fingers under microscopes."
